Year 9 IT 3

This lesson we worked on our spreadsheets some more and we talked for a bit about drop down lists and how much easier they made your spreadsheets work, so we got some help adding them in, you used the codes you made last week and then you made a new range/list and went onto making a VLOOKUP with those codes, you did this not only to create dropdown lists but to show individual price of a shoe for example but then there was another ingredient to add in. That wasn't the final shoe price, because you wanted to make a 20% profit like we agreed last week you added 20% of the original price to the the shoe and there we goâ€¦

I struggled quite a bit this week but i still enjoy IT and i know if i put a lot more effort into it then everything i do in it would be a lot better.
