Year 9 IT 1

In the first lesson of year 9 we logged onto google spreadsheets and started off with some really basic things such as simple addition and multiplication by using certain commands Mr Keen showed us. Also we went onto adding borders and colours that worked with each other and weren't to bright or intrusive as they didn't help whatsoever! 

We found out that on spreadsheets there are a lot of ways to shortcut things to make it much less tiresome. For instance pressing the button then clicking on the certain boxes ( like C,4 or D,3) then pressing enter rather than writing out the number with the plus sign over and over again, because it takes much longer. Also if you do something to one number then drag it down it does the process for the other for you. 

We then advanced to creating some variables. I liked having the freedom of doing whatever we wanted to our tables because we got to see what would work and look well in our tables and what didn't look as nice. I think the lesson was productive. In summary, it was a good lesson...
