Year 9 IT 4

This week we had a cover teacher in place of our normal one because he couldn't quite make it, so today he told us to create a new sheet inside our already created spreadsheet, so we called it "costs". We had to detail anything that money would have to be spent on, for example, employees, gas and fuel, rent for your offices, electricity and other bills, computers, other office equipment and many other things. We then had to create this blog for homework and were going to have our teacher with us next week.

I definitely struggled more this week but am looking forward to putting it right next week...
